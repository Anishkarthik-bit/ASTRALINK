# AstraLink: Orbital Ring Infrastructure

**AstraLink** is a modular orbital ring infrastructure concept designed to encircle Earth with a self-assembling platform for satellite repair, debris reclamation, in-orbit manufacturing, and space-based operations. **RECLAIM (Robotic Collection and Launch-Enabled Autonomous Interceptor Module)** is the autonomous system at the core of AstraLink, capable of collecting debris, repairing satellites, and assisting in orbital assembly using AI-driven swarm robotics.
